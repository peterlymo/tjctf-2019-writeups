This file was found in Evan Shi's 60 gb homework folder. What could he be up to? Figure out what the images mean in order to find out.

note: all letters in the flag are lowercase

## Solution

The logos are scrambled up

When I extracted it from the document, they were in these order.

I wrote down only the "simple letters".

	bh
	tj
	c
	t
	f
	{
	k
	n
	owu
	rf
	ile
	s
	}
	F1
	G
	metro
	azad
	netflix
	amazon
	axa
	siac
	honda
	alibaba

We see the flag here

	tj
	c
	t
	f
	{
	k
	n
	owu
	rf
	ile
	s
	}

## Flag
