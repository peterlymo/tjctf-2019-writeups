# Guess My Hashword
Crypto

## Challenge 

I bet you'll never guess my password!

I hashed tjctf{[word]} - my word has a captial letter, two lowercase letters, a number, and an underscore. Here's the md5 hash: 31f40dc5308fa2a311d2e2ba8955df6c

## Solution

Created a crude script in Ruby

	$ ruby solve.rb 
	a=A
	a=B
	a=C
	a=D
	Flag: tjctf{w0w_E}

## Flag

	tjctf{w0w_E}
