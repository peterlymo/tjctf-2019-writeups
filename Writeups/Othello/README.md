## Challenge 

That's not rain, is it?

## Solution

An audio with a person reading out letters in a very low frequency. I also realised that the audio playing in reversed.

---

Open in Audacity.

I took these steps to make it easier to hear.

- Low Pass Filter (1000Hz default settings)
- Change Speed (1.3 Speed Multiplier)
- Change Pitch (100% Percentage Change)
- Reverse

We listen to the audio and get this

	}?sr3v3?_aka{ftcjt

Reverse it and we get this

	tjctf{aka_?3v3rs?}

Title is a hint

> Othello https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reversi

> Reversi was most recently marketed by Mattel under the trademark Othello.

So make some intelligent guesses
